I feel too sick to get out of bed in the morning, but now I am staying up way too late.

![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Please provide me the meaning of the phrase, "exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis"

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] The phrase "exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis" is a Latin legal maxim that translates to "the exception proves the rule in cases not excepted." It means that the existence of an exception to a rule confirms the rule, and that the rule applies in all cases not covered by the exception.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] This is an argument attributed to Cicero, can you tell me more historical context of the argument?

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] The phrase "exceptio probat regulam in casibus non exceptis" is attributed to Cicero, a Roman statesman, lawyer, and philosopher. The context of the argument is related to legal reasoning and the interpretation of laws.

In Roman law, when a rule was established, it was assumed to apply in all cases unless an exception was explicitly stated. The presence of an exception confirmed the rule, and the rule was understood to apply in all cases not covered by the exception. This idea is related to the Latin maxim "Expressio unius est exclusio alterius" which means "the express mention of one thing implies the exclusion of others".

Cicero used this principle in his legal arguments, and it is reflected in his writing such as in his work "De Legibus" where he wrote "exception proves the rule in cases not excepted"

This principle is still used in legal reasoning today, it is used in the interpretation of laws, regulations, and contracts, where the presence of an exception confirms the rule and the rule is understood to apply in all cases not covered by the exception.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Write a short humorous dialogue as an example scenario to explain how to use this phrase. One of the characters should be a lobster who believes he is a human. The rule in question should be related to a crouton sledgehammer.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] Character 1: Hey, did you hear about the new rule at the restaurant? No more using crouton sledgehammers to crack open lobster shells!

Character 2: (who is a lobster and believes he is human) What?! That's ridiculous, I've been cracking open my own shells with a crouton sledgehammer for years!

Character 1: Well, I guess you're the exception that proves the rule.

Character 2: (Confused) Wait, what does that mean?

Character 1: It means that the rule applies to everyone else, but since you can crack open your own shells, you're the exception.

Character 2: (Feeling proud) Oh, I see! I guess I'm just too advanced for my crustacean counterparts.

Character 1: (Sarcastic) Yeah, you're a real lobster prodigy.

Character 2: (Excited) Hey, can I get that on a t-shirt?

Character 1: (Rolling eyes) Sure, why not.

In this scenario, the rule is that no one is allowed to use crouton sledgehammer to crack open lobster shells, but Character 2, the lobster who believes he is human, is an exception to this rule as he can crack open his own shells. Therefore, "the exception proves the rule" in this scenario, the rule applies to everyone else, but not to Character 2.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] This use of the phrase is an accepted contemporary use, which suggests the idea that every rule has an exception. However, the original context was to argue that the existence of an exception is itself proof of the exception of the rule; i.e. the exception to a rule could not exist if the rule did not exist. Try to write a second example dialogue but now using the phrase in this context. Incidentally, the characters are in the middle of a rap battle.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] Character 1: Yo, I'm the king of the rap game, ain't no rule I can't break

Character 2: (responding to the verse) Oh please, you ain't nothing special, just another fake

Character 1: (smirks) You're the exception that proves the rule

Character 2: (Confused) What do you mean?

Character 1: (rapping) It means you're the only one who thinks you can challenge me, but the fact that you're here, trying to compete, proves that my rule of being the best is true, and you're just an exception to it.

Character 2: (angrily) You're just using big words to hide your lack of skill, I'll show you who's the exception to the rule.

Character 1: (dismissively) Sure, try your best, but you'll never be the exception to the rule.

In this scenario, Character 1 is the rule, he is the king of the rap game and there is no one who can challenge him, but Character 2 is the exception, he thinks he can challenge him. However, the existence of Character 2, the exception, confirms the rule, that Character 1 is the king of the rap game. This use of the phrase confirms the original context, of the phrase, where the existence of the exception proves the rule.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] In other words, in order to be the best there must exist someone who is worse than you. However, in your scenario it begs the question of whether Character 2 was actually something that a King cannot be without. For example if Character 2 was a peasant, you might argue that a person is not a King without their peasants. However, the existence of a peasant may only be a necessary condition for a person to be a king, not a sufficient condition. For example, both characters could be Peasants. A more simple scenario is if Character 1 argues he is in a rap battle. Then the existence of Character 2 as his opponent is both necessary and sufficient for Character 1 to actually be in a rap battle.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] You're correct. In the scenario I provided, while the existence of Character 2 as an opponent confirms Character 1's claim of being the "king of the rap game," it doesn't necessarily mean that Character 1 is actually a "king" in the traditional sense. The scenario is more focused on the idea that the existence of an exception proves the rule in the sense that, in order to be the best, someone has to be the worst, but it doesn't prove that Character 1 is the king of the rap game in the traditional sense.

You also pointed out that in order for Character 1 to be in a rap battle, the existence of Character 2 as his opponent is both necessary and sufficient, that is true. The existence of an opponent is a necessary condition for a rap battle to take place, but it does not guarantee that Character 1 is the best rapper, only that he is participating in a rap battle.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Try to write a third dialogue now that uses the phrase properly. A lawyer is arguing about legal precedence, and cites a well-known expression as evidence of an exception to the law they are affirming.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]]  Lawyer 1: Your Honor, my client's case is the exception that proves the rule.

Judge: (intrigued) Explain yourself, Counselor.

Lawyer 1: The rule in question is that the previous legal precedent in this area of law applies to all similar cases. However, my client's case is the exception to that rule.

Judge: (nodding) And what evidence do you have to support this claim?

Lawyer 1: The legal principle of "equity overrides the letter of the law" is well established and well-known. This principle holds that in certain circumstances, fairness should take precedence over strict adherence to the law.

Judge: (considering) I see, and you believe that this principle applies in your client's case?

Lawyer 1: Exactly, Your Honor. The exception of equity overrides the letter of the law proves the rule that the previous legal precedent applies in all similar cases, but in this specific case, equity should take precedence.

Judge: (nodding) Very well, I will take this into consideration when making my ruling.

In this scenario, the lawyer is arguing that the previous legal precedent applies to all similar cases, but the client's case is an exception to this rule. The lawyer argues that the principle of "equity overrides the letter of the law" is the exception that proves the rule, as it confirms the rule that the legal precedent applies to similar cases, but in this specific case, equity should take precedence, which is the exception to the rule.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] This scenario might highlight a logical gap in the original argument. Assuming it is logically sound that the existence of an exception implies the existence of the rule it is excepting, the fact that an exception exists in the set of common expressions doesn't necessarily mean that the exception actually exists. For example, it is a common expression that if the teacher doesn't arrive in 15 minutes you are allowed to leave, despite this in reality depending on the school's policy. Now give me 3 examples of commonly believed exceptions to rules but are not actually valid exceptions. Be careful, your response should be about an exception that is commonly thought to exist, not about a rule that is commonly thought to exist.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] The "24 hour rule" in which you can return an item to a store within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund. While some stores may have this policy, it is not a universal rule and is not legally binding.

The "3 strikes rule" in which a person will be sentenced to life in prison after their third conviction of a serious crime. This rule varies by jurisdiction, and in reality, it's not a hard and fast rule.

The "5 second rule" in which food dropped on the ground is safe to eat as long as it's picked up within 5 seconds. This is a popular belief, but there is no scientific evidence to support it, and it's not a rule that is followed in any official capacity.

These examples show that commonly believed exceptions to rules may not actually be valid exceptions and that it's important to verify the rule and the exception before assuming their existence.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Let's start with #1, the 24 hour rule. There is a commonly held belief that this rule exists. This is not a commonly held belief about an exception to a rule exists. Explain why this answer does not properly answer my question.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] I apologize for the confusion, you are correct that my example of the "24-hour rule" does not properly answer your question as it is not an exception to a rule that is commonly thought to exist. It is rather a commonly held belief about a rule that exists.

The scenario I provided describes a belief that customers can return an item to the store within 24 hours of purchase for a full refund. This is not an exception to any rule, it's a belief about a rule that exists in some stores but not in all of them and not a legally binding rule.

You asked for examples of commonly believed exceptions to rules but are not actually valid exceptions, which means that it's an exception that is commonly thought to exist but doesn't actually exist.

I apologize for the confusion, my previous answer did not fully address your question and I should have provided different examples that met the criteria of your question.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Try to answer my question again now

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] The "exceptions for self-defense" in which a person can use deadly force in self-defense without facing legal consequences. While self-defense is a legal defense, the specific circumstances and the degree of force used can vary by jurisdiction and laws. It is not a universal exception.

The "exception for emergency" in which a person can break the law if it's for the greater good or in an emergency situation. While there may be some legal defenses that allow for breaking the law in specific circumstances, there is no blanket exception for emergency.

The "exception for ignorance" in which a person can claim ignorance of the law to avoid legal consequences. While ignorance of the law is not a criminal defense, it is not a valid exception to the rule that one is expected to abide by the laws.

These examples show that commonly believed exceptions to rules may not actually be valid exceptions and it's important to verify the rule and the exception before assuming their existence.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Summarize so far our strategy to respond to Cicero's argument

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] Cicero's argument states that the presence of an exception confirms the rule and the rule applies in all cases not covered by the exception. This principle is still used in legal reasoning today, it is used in the interpretation of laws, regulations, and contracts, where the presence of an exception confirms the rule and the rule is understood to apply in all cases not covered by the exception.

In order to determine whether an exception is valid, one should verify the rule and the exception before assuming their existence. It's important to understand that the existence of an exception implies the existence of the rule it is excepting, but the fact that an exception exists in the set of common expressions doesn't necessarily mean that the exception actually exists.

In addition, it's important to understand that legal defenses and exceptions are not universal, they vary by jurisdiction, and laws. Therefore, it's important to verify the rule and the exception before assuming their existence.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] First, give Fowler's example about special leave for men in barracks. Second, can our strategy be used logically contest the conclusion, that there exists a rule requiring men to usually be inside earlier. If not, why?

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] Fowler's example about special leave for men in barracks is that men in barracks were usually required to be inside earlier than other men. However, there was an exception for special leave, which allowed men in barracks to be outside past the usual curfew. This exception confirms the rule that men in barracks were usually required to be inside earlier, but not in cases where they were granted special leave.

Our strategy for verifying the existence of a rule and exception can be used to logically contest the conclusion that there exists a rule requiring men to usually be inside earlier. One would have to gather evidence and analyze the context to determine if the rule and exception are valid. For example, one could question the legitimacy of the rule by examining the reasoning behind it, the evidence supporting it, and any alternative explanations. Additionally, one could examine the exception to the rule, to determine if it is a valid exception, by analyzing the circumstances under which it applies, and whether it is consistent with the rule.

It's important to note that our strategy is just a guide and it's not a guarantee of a certain outcome. The conclusion of the argument that there exists a rule requiring men to usually be inside earlier will depend on the context, the evidence and the arguments presented.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Well this strategy is more akin to removing weakly true statements concerning the existence of the exception. So assuming that special leave is in fact being given, then Fowler has met the sufficient condition for the existence of the rule. 

Let's be more precise and use Fowler's statement as "Special leave is given for men to be out of barracks tonight till 11.00 p.m."

In this case, it is possible that the special leave to be out does imply the existence of a rule, just a different rule than originally stated. It is assumed the rule is, unless stated otherwise, that the men must be inside earlier. However, it could also be the case that the real rule is that men are forced to stay outside of the barracks, for example in a dangerous environment and they wish to go inside. In this context, the original rule is that men are forced as punishment to stay out of the barracks until midnight, but as stated otherwise in the rule they are allowed to come inside earlier than usual.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] You are correct that the strategy I described is more akin to removing weakly true statements concerning the existence of the exception. And in the case of Fowler's statement "Special leave is given for men to be out of barracks tonight till 11.00 p.m." It could imply the existence of a rule, just a different rule than originally stated.

In the example of men being forced to stay outside of the barracks, for example in a dangerous environment, the original rule could be that men are forced as punishment to stay out of the barracks until midnight, but as stated otherwise, they are allowed to come inside earlier than usual because of the special leave. This implies that the rule is not just a general curfew, but a punishment, and the exception of special leave allows them to come back earlier which is not a general exception but a specific one. This is an example of how interpreting the context, the reasoning behind the rule and the exception, can lead to a different understanding of the rule and the exception.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Now we have 2 strategies for responding to this argument. Neither completely dismantles the logical soundness of the argument but could be argued against specific examples. Give 2 examples where the exception to the rule argument is made and correctly is responded to using each strategy.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] Strategy 1: Verifying the existence of the rule and exception
Example: In a workplace, there is a rule that employees are not allowed to use their personal phones during work hours. An exception to this rule is made for employees who need to be on call for emergency situations. An employee argues that the rule is unjust because they should be able to use their personal phone during work hours for personal reasons. In response, a manager could use the strategy of verifying the existence of the rule and exception by pointing out that the rule is in place to maintain productivity and the exception is made for emergency situations that require immediate attention.

Strategy 2: Examining the context, reasoning and alternative explanations
Example: In a school, there is a rule that students are not allowed to bring electronic devices to class. An exception to this rule is made for students who have a medical condition that requires them to use an electronic device. A student argues that the rule is unjust because it should not apply to them, as they need to use their electronic device for entertainment during class. In response, a teacher could use the strategy of examining the context, reasoning and alternative explanations by pointing out that the rule is in place to minimize distractions and the exception is made for students who have a medical condition that requires the use of an electronic device, not for entertainment purposes.

Both strategies can help to respond to the argument of exception to the rule by providing a logical counter-argument and evidence, but they focus on different aspects of the rule and the exception. The first strategy focuses on verifying the existence of the rule and exception, while the second strategy focuses on examining the context, reasoning and alternative explanations of the rule and the exception.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] First example is incorrect. Instead, the employee is arguing to their manager about unfair workplace rules. They cite a well-known office expression that "the only time I can check my phone is if the building is on fire", and because of this they are upset about a rule that employees can't check their phone during work hours. Our response is that the exception might exist as an expression, but is not actually a rule that the managers have codified. Of course, employees might not be allowed to have their phones for a different reason, but by this point the employee has already failed to convince their boss of anything. In this case, the "exception to the rule" exists but the rule does not.

Second, I think this is correct. Perhaps the young student thinks that student with medical conditions are just getting special treatment and so they get to play games on their phone for fun during class, but when in fact that is not actually the rule in place. The student believed the exception to the rule proved the existence of a rule that you can use phone for entertainment purposes during class only if you have a medical condition, when in fact a different rule exists which is that students with a medical condition may use their phone if it helps them be productive.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] You are correct, my first example is incorrect and I apologize for the mistake. Your rephrasing of the first example better illustrates the scenario, where an employee argues about an exception to the rule that does not exist and is not codified by the management. The employee cites a well-known office expression "the only time I can check my phone is if the building is on fire", but in reality, this exception does not exist as a rule and should not be used as an argument to change the rule.

Regarding the second example, you are correct, the student might believe that students with medical conditions are getting special treatment, and that is the reason they get to use their phone during class for entertainment purposes. But, in fact, the rule is different, which is that students with a medical condition may use their phone if it helps them be productive. My apologies for any confusion caused by the previous incorrect statement.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Let's revisit the more commonly accepted rhetorical use of "the exception that proves the rule", which is when we highlight the unusualness of a situation to highlight the prevalent tendency. For example, "A local farmer rents his fields to a rock festival, which disturbs the quiet." The exception refers to disturbing the quiet, which gives the rule of thumb rule that the farm is usually quiet. Give me a list of 5 more examples of this. Write the sentence, then explain what are the exception and the rule of thumb rule.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] "A teacher is seen using a smartphone during class, which is against school policy."

The exception is the teacher using a smartphone during class, which goes against the rule of thumb rule that teachers are not allowed to use smartphones during class.

"A friend always pays for dinner, but tonight they forgot their wallet."

The exception is the friend forgetting their wallet, which highlights the rule of thumb rule that the friend usually pays for dinner.

"A car is parked illegally, but it has a handicap permit."

The exception is the car being parked illegally but having a handicap permit, which highlights the rule of thumb rule that cars should not be parked illegally.

"A professional athlete is caught using performance-enhancing drugs, which is against the rules of the league."

The exception is the professional athlete using performance-enhancing drugs, which goes against the rule of thumb rule that athletes should not use performance-enhancing drugs.

"A child is seen eating candy before dinner, which is not allowed according to their parents' rules."

The exception is the child eating candy before dinner, which goes against the rule of thumb rule that children should not eat candy before dinner according to their parents' rules.

These examples show the exception to a general rule of thumb that is usually followed and the exception highlights the general rule. The exception is unusual and it makes the general rule more noticeable.

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043743.png]] Do you think all 5 answers were proper examples of what I asked for? Would you like to rewrite any of them?

--------------------------
![[Pasted image 20230113043940.png]] I apologize, upon re-reading my previous response, I realize that not all the examples are proper examples of what you asked for.

An example like "A teacher is seen using a smartphone during class, which is against school policy." is not a proper example of the rhetorical use of "the exception that proves the rule", as it is not highlighting the prevalent tendency of teachers not using smartphones in class but rather stating a rule that is in place.

An example like "A child is seen eating candy before dinner, which is not allowed according to their parents' rules." is also not proper, as it is not highlighting a prevalent tendency of children not eating candy before dinner but rather stating a rule that is in place.

I apologize for the confusion and I will rewrite these examples to better fit the request.

"A teacher is seen using a smartphone during class, which is unusual as most teachers avoid using them during class time."

The exception is the teacher using a smartphone during class, which highlights the rule of thumb that most teachers avoid using smartphones during class time.

"A child is seen eating candy before dinner, which is unusual as most children are not allowed to eat candy before dinner."

The exception is the child eating candy before dinner, which highlights the rule of thumb that most children are not allowed to eat candy before dinner.
